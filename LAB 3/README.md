# Preparation

This lab simulates the probability a person received the winning ticket. They will do it for both the Colorado Lotto+ and the California Lotto. Make sure to change the numbers to ensure that it is using the [most recent lottery numbers and payouts](https://www.coloradolottery.com/en/games/lotto/drawings/). There are multiple payouts for 5x, 4x, 3x, etc. Use the 5x payouts. 

If you are using Canvas for submissions, ensure it is clear which numbers are used for problem 2. Many students assumed the glitched ticket was the ticket used, and not the bulleted items. 

When helping students for the California Superlotto, it may be useful to break the probabilities down into two random variables: 

- X: probability of first 5 digits
- Y: probability of mega number

Since these are independent, students can calculate the probabilities separately and mutliply them together.
