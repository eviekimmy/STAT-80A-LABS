# Preparation

This lab isn split into two parts. The first part is another law of large numbers demonstration, though this time we are looking at how variance effects convergence. The idea is that, while all running averages should eventually converge to -2/28, the ones with a larger variance will take longer. You can have students adjust what kind of straight up bets, split bets, etc. they can use, but they should all give the same thing. The only thing that the different kinds of bets effect are the combined bets and what they converge to. 

You may need to give a demonstration to students on how to calculate mean and variance. I recommend using the straight up bet calculations as an example. They may also need help with calculating mean and variance for the combined bet portion once the table is filled.

For the second part of the lab, students just need to adjust bias level and number of spins until the p-value is less than 0.05. They are not familiar with chi quared goodness of fit tests, so no need to explain the details. The main idea is that it is very difficult to detect bias.
