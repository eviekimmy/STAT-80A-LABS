# Solutions

## Problem 1

If we assign probabiliies $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ to strategies $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$, the three expectations are 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[B_1] &= 0p_1 + 5p_2 - 3p_3 \\
\mathbb{E}[B_2] &= 5p_1 + 0p_2 - 3p_3 \\
\mathbb{E}[B_3] &= 10p_1 - 2p_2 + 0p_3 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Problem 2

Now, instead of each column, go by each row.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[A_1] &= 0q_1 + 4q_2 - 10q_3 \\
\mathbb{E}[A_2] &= -5q_1 + 0q_2 + 2q_3 \\
\mathbb{E}[A_3] &= 3q_1 - 6q_2 + 0q_3 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

You can also do it using the opposite sign (either one is ok because you are just mutliplying all equations by a scaler).

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{E}[A_1] &= 0q_1 - 4q_2 + 10q_3 \\
\mathbb{E}[A_2] &= 5q_1 + 0q_2 - 2q_3 \\
\mathbb{E}[A_3] &= -3q_1 + 6q_2 + 0q_3 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Problem 3

The final condition is that all probabilities must sum to 1
$$
p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1
$$

or 

$$
q_1 + q_2 + q_3 = 1
$$

## Problem 4

This is just a descriptive based question. As long as they describe accurate behavior of the graph (i.e. that it approaches the dotted horizontal line) they are good.

## Problem 5

Any answer is ok.

## Problem 6

For the first one, the dominant strategy for both players is to defect. Therefore, is ***one*** nash equilibrium. 

For the second, again there is one dominant strategy for both. Therefore, is ***one*** nash equilibrium. 

For the third, there are ***two*** nash equilibria. For both, this is when one defects while the other cooperates.

## Problem 7

For the graph, Player A is the red line and Player B is the blue line. What they are looking for is when the red line is below the blue line. As students move the slider for the probability of Player B cooperating, they should notice that the red line is below the blue line when their probability of Player A cooperating is *less* then Player B's. 

## Problem 8

Any answer is ok.
