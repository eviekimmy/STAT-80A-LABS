# Preparation

This lab was assigned the same day as students were setting up R and RStudio, which usually takes the whole session. Therefore, this lab is shorter. For now, all questions have the probability slider set to 0.5. However, it is adjustable in case you would like to add or adjust questions that explore the plot behavior as the probability is adjusted. 

***Some of these answers depend on the inputted seed. Make sure students use the seed that was assigned to them to complete the lab. For Fall 2025, this was the last four digits of their student ID.***
