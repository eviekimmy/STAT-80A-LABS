# Preparation

This lab was assigned the same day as students were setting up R and RStudio, which usually takes the whole session. Therefore, this lab is shorter. For now, all questions have the probability slider set to 0.5. However, it is adjustable in case you would like to add or adjust questions that explore the plot behavior as the probability is adjusted. 

***Some of these answers depend on the inputted seed. Make sure students use the seed that was assigned to them to complete the lab. For Fall 2025, this was the last four digits of their student ID.***

# Solutions

## Problem 1

The plot should have a dot at the last observation. This is what they will use for their empirical estimates of the probability, odds in favor and odds against. Since this is specific to each student, run `Lab-1-Summary.R` with their random seed to validate their answer. 

## Problem 2

Again, run `Lab-1-Summary.R` with their random seed to validate their answer to the first part. The second half, as long as they observe that it approaches the true value 0.5 they get full credit.

## Problem 3

Any answer is ok. If students get stuck, the idea is mainly that we can verify if our theoretical values match if we run enough simulations.

## Problem 4

Again, run `Lab-1-Summary.R` with their random seed to validate their answer.

## Problem 5

The range should increase as the number of runs increases, but the mean probability should approach the true value of 0.5. 

## Problem 6

Any answer is ok. Similar reasoning from [Problem 3](#problem-4)
