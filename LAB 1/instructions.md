# Overview
Simulations are often used to verify empirically a result calculated by hand, or 
to calculate values that require too many computations to do with pen and paper. 
This lab will show you how the law of large numbers is utilized to perform these
simulations. 

You will be generating plots similar to Figure 1.1 in your textbook. You can 
control the number of flips performed, how biased the coin is towards heads, and
how many you run the experiment. Take some time to experiment with the sliders 
and inputs to see how they affect the plot. A brief demonstration will also be 
presented at the beginning of class.

# Preparation
Please set the seed to the last four digits of your student id. 

# One run
First, ensure that the probability set to 0.5, number of runs to 1, and number 
of flips is set to 1000. Hover your cursor over the last number in the run and 
use it to estimate the odds (both in favor and against) of getting heads. How do 
these measured quantities compare to their theoretical counterparts? Compare 
mean, odds in favor and odds against.

Now, repeat these calculations for when number of flips is 5000 and then 10,000.
What happens when you increase the number of flips? To what precision do they 
resemble the theoretical values (i.e. what decimal do they start to differ)?

Use what you just learned to describe the role that the law of large numbers 
plays in simulation.

# Comparing Multiple Runs
Set the number of runs back to 1000. Now, start increasing the number of runs to 
3, 5, and 10 runs. Report the mean, variance, and range for the final point at 
each run.

What happens to these measured quantities as you increase the number of runs?

Use what you just learned to describe the role that the law of averages 
plays in simulation.
